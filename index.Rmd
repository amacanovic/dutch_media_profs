This website shows the script for the Dutch Media Profs project.
This project explores gender inequalities in media representation between men and women 
professors in the Netherlands.

The project is conducted by [Bas Hofstra](https://www.bashofstra.com) and [Ana Macanovic](https://amacanovic.github.io/)
at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en).

This project answers these questions by considering whether and why women professors 
are represented in news and social media at different numbers than men professors. 
This representation in the public arena has become increasingly important for 
professors as the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the general public is 
a growing and essential part of professorsâ€™ activities and evaluation. This project
sets out to study this among all Dutch professors (1990-2021) through a series of 
new database linkages and computational methods.

We start with a dataset of 6830 professors as per NARCIS (National Academic Research
and Collaboration Information System), a former Dutch nationala information portal
for Dutch scientific data and publications. 

For each professor, we collect the following data:

- Publication, citation, affiliation, topic, concept, and grant data from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/)
- Printed news articles containing a professors first and last names and a set of
keyword related to their academic roles from [LexisNexis](https://www.lexisnexis.com/).
- Online news mentions and number of Tweets pertaining to their publications from [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/)
- Dutch grant data from [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/) and ERC grant data from the [ERC datahub](https://erc.easme-web.eu?mode=7&countries=NL):
